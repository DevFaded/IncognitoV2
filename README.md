# IncognitoV2

**IncognitoV2** is the official source code release from the original developers. This repository provides a single, malware‑free location for exploring, auditing, and extending the tool.

## Key Shit

- **Execution Bridge**  
  IncognitoV2 no longer includes a built‑in execution bridge, you’ll need to implement your own.

- **DataModel & Offsets**  
  You’ll need to update its methods and class offsets, many of which you can get from the decompiled Roblox 2016 client.

## Learning and Usage

This repository is a resource for learning and understanding. We hope that by making this code available, we can support the community in using and improving their own software safely and effectively.

## Disclaimer

> This version was still in development. It may be unstable or incomplete, and will likely be patched in future releases.

## License

Before using or distributing IncognitoV2, **read and comply with the [LICENSE](/LICENSE.md)**. Adherence to the license terms is required for all derivatives.
