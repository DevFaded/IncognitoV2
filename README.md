# IncognitoV2

**IncognitoV2** is the official source code release from the original developers. This repository provides a single, malware‑free location for exploring, auditing, and extending the tool.

## Crap You Have Too Add

- **Execution Bridge**  
  IncognitoV2 no longer includes a built‑in execution bridge—you’ll need to implement your own.

- **DataModel & Offsets**  
  You’ll need to update its methods and class offsets—many of which you can get from the decompiled Roblox 2016 client.

- **Unfinished Leak**  
  This is an early, unfinished build. Expect bugs, incomplete features, and patches.

## Learning & Contribution

This repo is intended as a learning resource—study the implementation, compare to the 2016 Roblox internals, and improve safely. Your pull requests are welcome, but please:

1. Fork the repo.  
2. Create a branch for your changes (e.g. `add-exec-bridge`).  
3. Submit a Pull Request with your updates.

## Disclaimer

> This version was still in development. It may be unstable or incomplete, and will likely be patched in future releases.

## License

Before using or distributing IncognitoV2, **read and comply with the [LICENSE](/LICENSE.md)**. Adherence to the license terms is required for all derivatives.
